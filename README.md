# POCKET ðŸ’° 
A new cryptocurrency powered by NodeJS

## The project ðŸ“š

Pocket is a new cryptocurrency create by **Miguel Ferreira** (github.com/esfoliante) with the purpose of being versatile and affoardable to anyone that has the minimum mining resources.

The main goal with pocket is to be easy to implement on various websites or applications that need a secure transaction, making a "face to face battle" again Bitcoin or Ethereum, the current giants in the field of cryptocurrency.

## Status ðŸ“ˆ

Right now *"pocket"* is not 100% functional.

You may encounter some bugs in the process but the whole blockchain is built, alongside the logic that it envolves.

Right now you **don't have the possibility** the make **transactions** or **create a wallet** but surely in a few days I will make that a reality.


## Value ðŸ’¶

Right now Pocket hasn't any value at all, as it is just in testing.

However, the price of a pocket (**1 pk**) will be calculated as the market grows, just like the other cryptocurrencies.

For insance, 1 pk could be worth 3â‚¬Â in one day, but if lots of people start to demand for pockets, the price can grow to 6â‚¬.

**The market defines the price.**
